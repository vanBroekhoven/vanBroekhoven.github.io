      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tim van Broekhoven. I recently graduated as an Electrical Engineer and now I'm commited to chase my dream to become a full stack software developer. I'm currently working with React as my front-end framework and I'm using ExpressJS on the backend. This way, I can emerge myself into the Javascript world. When I finished my current projects, I want to replace ExpressJS for the Django and Flask Python frameworks for backend work to switch it up. So stay tuned to see what I will create next! Thank you ðŸ’œ",
